# hello-world
Hello everyone, my name is Gabriel and i'm from Brazil. I'm getting into the world of programming, studying and researching a lot.
I was recommended to GitHub and even not being able to help with projects right now, i'm here to see and learn.
So if you are reading this and want to leave a message, some tips, things that i should and shouldn't do, feel free to it. I will love to learn from you.
